## How to run
Every model has its own python script that takes in data from `./Dataset` and generates output file in `./output`
To switch between 1st and 2nd datasets, we created dsnum variable in every script that will correspond to given dataset number.
For example, to run just invoke `python GNB.py` in the terminal and it will automatically proceed with the dataset corresponding to dsnum.
